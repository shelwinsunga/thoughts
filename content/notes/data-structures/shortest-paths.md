# Graph Problems Summary

<!-- Create a table with: problem, problem description, solution, eficiency -->
| Problem | Description | Efficiency |
| --- | --- | --- |
| S-T paths | Find a path from `s` to every reachable vertex |  | $O(V+E)$ |
| S-T shortest paths | Find a shortest path from `s` to every reachable vertex |  | $O(V+E)$ |

Last time, we saw two ways to find paths in a graph: DFS and BFS.

Which is better?
