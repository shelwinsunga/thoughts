In computer science, it can be hard to explain the difference between the easy and the virtually impossible. The progress of deep learning has bridged this gap considerably in the last few years.

## Computer Vision and Deep Learning

In 2012, a Stanford Research team pulled in a bunch of world-class computer scientists and mathematicians to analyze images of breast cancer tissue. They made a lot of definitions for relationships they found: The way contiguous epithelial regions were connected to nuclear neighbors, morpholologically regular and ireegular nuclei, epithelial and stromal objects, and other characteristics. This took years. They then used classical machine learning methods (`L1-regularized logistic regression`) to build a model which could accurately predict breast cancer.

The reason we use neural networks is so we don't have to draft those relationships - it can observe and create them.
