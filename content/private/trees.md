A tree consists of 
- A set of nodes
- A set of edges that connect those nodes
  - Constraint: There is exactly one path between any two nodes.

In a rooted tree, we call one node priviledged node the root.
- Every node N except the root has exactly one parent, deifned as the first node on the path from N to the root.
- The root is usually depicted as tthe top of the tree (kind of backwards from how we usually think about trees)
- A node with no child is called a leaf.

In a rooted binary tree, every node has either 0, 1, or 2 children (subtrees).
