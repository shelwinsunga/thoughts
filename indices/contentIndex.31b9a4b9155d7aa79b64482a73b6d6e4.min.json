If you're designing a system, if you can possibly solve it with a single computer, without a distributed system, do that. It's **always** easier that way. Try everything else before a distributed system, because they're not simpler.\n\n## Reasons we use distributed systems\n1. Performance: How do I get 1000 computers to give me 1000x the compute?\n    - The reason people use lots of cooperating computers is because they need high-performance, and to accomplish that they need parallelism. \n2. Fault Tolerance\n    - Have two computers do the exact same thing, if one fails give the task to the other one.\n3. Physical\n    - Some problems are naturally spread out into space and become inherently physically distributed systems.\n    - Two Banks across the country dealing with the transfer of money.\n4. Security \n    - Improve security by splitting things between multiple computers, resulting in isolation.\n\n\n\n## Basic Challenges\n\n##### Concurrency \n\nBecause distributed systems compute concurrently, you get all the problems that come up with concurrent programming. Complex interactions and weird timing dependant stuff make the world a scary place.\n\n##### Partial Failure\n\nDistributed is hard because with all the different computers in addition to a network, you will have unexpected failure patterns. If you were working with a single computer, it's usually the case that the computer is working, or it's not. A distributed system may have multiple computers not working, or a single computer not working. A part of the network might be down. These result in partial failures.\n\n##### Performance\n\nThough we build computers to obtain high-performance, there's a lot of roadblocks in the way. It takes careful design to get the performance you feel you deserve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-03T15:12:39.72354691Z","tags":null},"/notes/6.824/Infrastructure-for-Applications":{"title":"Infrastructure for Applications","content":"\nA lot of our goal is to discover **abstractions**, or ways of simplifying the interface of distributed storage and infrastructure so that it is easy to build applications on top of it. We want to *hide* the fact the system is distributed.\n\n# Implementation \n\n1. Remote Procedure Call (RPC)\n    - Mask the fact you're communicating over an unreliable network.\n\n2. Threads\n    - A way of structuring concurrent operations so that the programmer lives a happier life.\n\n3. Concurrency control\n    - We'll need to spend a certain amount of time thinking about this.\n\n## Scalability\n\nUsually the high-level goal of building a distributed system is to build something with scalable speed-up. It's the idea that with 2 times the computer resources, I should get 2 times the throughput. The alternative is to pay programmers to restructure your software. \n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-03T15:12:39.72354691Z","tags":null},"/notes/World-Building":{"title":"World Building","content":"\n## Emissaries Guide To Worlding\n[James Stuber's Blog](https://jamesstuber.com/emissaries/)\n\nWell-built worlds enable *new stories*.

To please only ourselves?\n\n## As Thinking\nTed Chiang on the power of written language in *Truth of Fact, Truth of Feeling*:\n\n\u003e Writing was not just a way to record what someone said; it could help you decide what you would say before you said it. And words were not just the pieces of speaking; they were the pieces of thinking. When you wrote them down, you could grasp your thoughts like bricks in your hands and push them into different arrangements. Writing let you look at your thoughts in a way you couldn’t if you were just talking, and having seen them, you could improve them, make them stronger and more elaborate.\n\n## As Claims\n\u003e We write not only to state what we have think but also to show why others might agree with it and why it matters. We also know that whatever it is we think, it is never the entire truth. Our conclusions are partial, incomplete, and always subject to challenge. So we write in a way that allows others to test our reasoning: we present our best thinking as a series of claims, reasons, and responses to imagined challenges, so that readers can see not only what we think, but whether they ought to agree.\n\u003e \n\u003e -- *Writing in College*, by Joseph M. Williams and Lawrence McEnerney\n\nThesis can contain 4 main types of claims\n1. Claims of fact or definition: argue about what the definition of something is or whether something is a settled fact\n2. Claims of cause and effect: argue that one person, thing, or event caused another thing or event to occur\n3. Claims about value: what something is worth, whether we value it or not, how we would rate or categorize something\n4. Claims about solutions or policies: argue for or against a certain solution or policy approach to a problem\n\nThese aim to get the reader to say \"that's interesting, I'd like to know more\"\n\n1. Logos: logic (See also: list of [[thoughts/logical fallacies]])\n2. Ethos: reputational appeal of the writer\n3. Pathos: emotional appeal\n\n## As query\n[Source](https://escapingflatland.substack.com/p/search-query)\n\n**A blog post is _a search query_. You write to find your tribe; you write so they will know what kind of fascinating things they should route to your inbox.**\n\nSee also: [[thoughts/Internet|niche at scale and the internet]]\n\n\u003e Writing for a general public, you need to be broad and a bit bland. I didn’t want a general public. I wanted a specific set of people, the people who could help me along as a human being obsessed with certain intellectual problems. I didn’t know who these people _were_. I only knew that they existed. Hence my writing was a search query. It needed to be phrased in such a way that it found these people and, if necessary, filtered others.\n\nTwo opposing forces to this:\n1. Having idiosyncratic interests that grow in complexity means that _if you pursue_ _them too far you will end up obsessed with things that no one else around you cares about_.\n2.  Humans tend to mimic the interests of those around them (see: [[thoughts/mimetic|memetic thinking]])\n\nWe can reach a sort of equilibrium by writing and doing [[thoughts/building in public|things in public]].","lastmodified":"2022-11-03T15:12:39.903549316Z","tags":null},"/notes/zero-sum":{"title":"Zero-sum","content":"\nAs opposed to [positive sum](thoughts/positive%20sum.md)\n\n## [Group Limits](thoughts/group%20limits.md)\nIn a local context, relationships may be positive sum.

Writing let you look at your thoughts in a way you couldn’t if you were just talking, and having seen them, you could improve them, make them stronger and more elaborate.\n\n## As Claims\n\u003e We write not only to state what we have think but also to show why others might agree with it and why it matters. We also know that whatever it is we think, it is never the entire truth. Our conclusions are partial, incomplete, and always subject to challenge. So we write in a way that allows others to test our reasoning: we present our best thinking as a series of claims, reasons, and responses to imagined challenges, so that readers can see not only what we think, but whether they ought to agree.\n\u003e \n\u003e -- *Writing in College*, by Joseph M. Williams and Lawrence McEnerney\n\nThesis can contain 4 main types of claims\n1. Claims of fact or definition: argue about what the definition of something is or whether something is a settled fact\n2. Claims of cause and effect: argue that one person, thing, or event caused another thing or event to occur\n3. Claims about value: what something is worth, whether we value it or not, how we would rate or categorize something\n4. Claims about solutions or policies: argue for or against a certain solution or policy approach to a problem\n\nThese aim to get the reader to say \"that's interesting, I'd like to know more\"\n\n1. Logos: logic (See also: list of [[thoughts/logical fallacies]])\n2. Ethos: reputational appeal of the writer\n3. Pathos: emotional appeal\n\n## As query\n[Source](https://escapingflatland.substack.com/p/search-query)\n\n**A blog post is _a search query_. You write to find your tribe; you write so they will know what kind of fascinating things they should route to your inbox.**\n\nSee also: [[thoughts/Internet|niche at scale and the internet]]\n\n\u003e Writing for a general public, you need to be broad and a bit bland. I didn’t want a general public. I wanted a specific set of people, the people who could help me along as a human being obsessed with certain intellectual problems. I didn’t know who these people _were_. I only knew that they existed. Hence my writing was a search query. It needed to be phrased in such a way that it found these people and, if necessary, filtered others.\n\nTwo opposing forces to this:\n1. Having idiosyncratic interests that grow in complexity means that _if you pursue_ _them too far you will end up obsessed with things that no one else around you cares about_.\n2.  Humans tend to mimic the interests of those around them (see: [[thoughts/mimetic|memetic thinking]])\n\nWe can reach a sort of equilibrium by writing and doing [[thoughts/building in public|things in public]].","lastmodified":"2022-11-03T15:12:40.087551775Z","tags":null},"/thoughts/zero-sum":{"title":"Zero-sum","content":"\nAs opposed to [positive sum](thoughts/positive%20sum.md)\n\n## [Group Limits](thoughts/group%20limits.md)\nIn a local context, relationships may be positive sum.
