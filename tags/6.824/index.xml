A single computer can often stay up for years. However, if you&amp;rsquo;re building a system with thousands of computers, that means you&amp;rsquo;re going to have about 3 computer failiures per day.</description></item><item><title>Infrastructure for Applications</title><link>https://shelwinsunga.github.io/thoughts/notes/6.824/Infrastructure-for-Applications/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shelwinsunga.github.io/thoughts/notes/6.824/Infrastructure-for-Applications/</guid><description>See also: Introduction to Distributed Systems
A lot of our goal is to discover abstractions, or ways of simplifying the interface of distributed storage and infrastructure so that it is easy to build applications on top of it.</description></item><item><title>Introduction to Distributed Systems</title><link>https://shelwinsunga.github.io/thoughts/notes/6.824/DistributedSystemsIntro/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shelwinsunga.github.io/thoughts/notes/6.824/DistributedSystemsIntro/</guid><description>The core of a distributed system is a set of cooperating computers that are communicating with each other over a network to get some coherent task done.</description></item><item><title>System Scalability</title><link>https://shelwinsunga.github.io/thoughts/notes/6.824/Scalability/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shelwinsunga.github.io/thoughts/notes/6.824/Scalability/</guid><description>Usually the high-level goal of building a distributed system is to build something with scalable speed-up. It&amp;rsquo;s the idea that with 2 times the computer resources, I should get 2 times the throughput.</description></item></channel></rss>
