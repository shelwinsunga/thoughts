The depth of a node is how far it is from the root The height of a tree is the depth of its deepest leaf The average depth of a tree is the average depth of a tree&amp;rsquo;s nodes.</description></item><item><title>BST Tree Height</title><link>https://shelwinsunga.github.io/thoughts/notes/data-structures/BSTheight/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shelwinsunga.github.io/thoughts/notes/data-structures/BSTheight/</guid><description>Height varies dramatically between &amp;ldquo;bushy&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;spindly&amp;rdquo; trees.
Bushy trees have a height of roughly $log(n)$. Spindly trees have a height of $n$.</description></item><item><title>Trees</title><link>https://shelwinsunga.github.io/thoughts/notes/data-structures/trees/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shelwinsunga.github.io/thoughts/notes/data-structures/trees/</guid><description>A tree consists of
